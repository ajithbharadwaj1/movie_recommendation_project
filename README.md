A content-based recommender system that recommends movies similar to the movie selected by the user.


## Overview

The movies are recommended based on the content of the movie you entered or selected. The main parameters that are considered for the recommendations are the genre, director, and top 3 casts. The details of the movies, such as title, genre, runtime, rating, poster, casts, etc., are fetched from [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api).
